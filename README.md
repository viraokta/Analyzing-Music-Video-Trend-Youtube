# Analyzing-Music-Video-Trend-Youtube
Digital technology is growing rapidly and is becoming a platform for those who want to present their work. Youtube shares web videos which mean that users can watch, share works, and interact through the comments column that has been provided from a work site. One of the works that can be seen on Youtube is a music video. The music video aims to increase promotion, as well as to visualize an interpretation of a song. We will find out the search trends on Youtube using the Pytrends module. Pytrends is an API for Google Trends that functions to pick up trends in the Google search engine. For the keywords, I will use the words “Music Videos” and “MV”. I took data with a period of 5 years.
